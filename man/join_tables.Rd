\title{Join two tables or layers}
\usage{
join_tables(f_left, f_right, j_type, pk, fk)
}
\arguments{
\item{f_left}{Table with primary keys and left table in joins.}

\item{f_right}{Table with foreign keys and right table in joins. For
non-spatial joins this must be a non-spatial data frame - if it is a spatial
table it will be converted to non-spatial.}

\item{j_type}{A string specifying the type of join to perform.}

\item{pk}{A character vector of primary keys. The primary and foreign keys do
not need to have the same names but the order of the keys matters.}

\item{fk}{A character vector of foreign keys. The primary and foreign keys do
not need to have the same names but the order of the keys matters.}
}
\value{
\code{j_df} A table joined on primary and foreign keys. Will be of
  class \code{sf} (i.e. spatial features) if f_left is spatial and of class
  sf. Otherwise returns a data frame.
}
\description{
Perform an inner join or left join operation on two tables based on *n*
number of primary and foreign keys. Perform joins using
\code{\link[dplyr]{inner_join}} and \code{\link[dplyr]{left_join}}.
}
\details{
Primary and foreign keys are converted to character vectors before joining.
