This vignette provides a set of instructions for deploying maplandscape on [Google Cloud Run]().

Google Cloud Run is a stateless service whereas Shiny is stateful and based on user sessions, successive user requests to a Shiny application depend on each other. 

Each user's requests must be sent to the appropriate instance of a Shiny application. 

Shiny apps can be deployed as containerised applications on Google Cloud Run. 

## Build maplandscape as a docker image
